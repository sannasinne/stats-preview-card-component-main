## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

During this project I learned to upgrade my skills with Flexbox and center aligning the items in the viewport.

I also learned a new way to make a overlay color for an image using mix-blend-mole:

```
```img {
  mix-blend-mode: multiply;
}
```

### Continued development

In furtere projects I want to level up my skills with Flexbox.

### Useful resources

- [css tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me to refresh my memory of Flexbox.
